# three-vite
threejs starter using ESM modules + vite

# How to run
Make sure you're running a more recent Node version that supports ES Modules, as Vite requires it. If using nvm, I suggest using version 17 at least.

```
nvm use 17.0
npm install
npm run dev
```

visit the port that the project is running at, and you should see a green rotating cube
